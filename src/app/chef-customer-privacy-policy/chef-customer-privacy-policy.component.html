                Chefs make sure they consider and balance any potential impact
                on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before they
                process your personal data for their legitimate interests. Chefs
                do not use your personal data for activities where their
                interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless Chefs have
                your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
                You can obtain further information about how Chefs assess their
                legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in
